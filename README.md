# Harvest

This repository contains modules for staking LP coins received for adding liquidity to [Liquidswap](https://github.com/pontem-network/liquidswap) pools. By staking LP coins, user receives a reward in DGEN coins, which are evenly distributed among all participants. Each LP staking pool has a reward rate per second set by the pool creator. User can unstake own LP coins without loss of profit at any time.
